        <h3>What is "Just Birds And More?"</h3>
        <p>This site began as a passion project to help me learn web development. It was important for me to pick a project that was both achievable and something I could imagine others using. I settled on creating a bird database, and from there
        the idea evolved into a nature database. The name "Just Birds And More" comes from a personal in-joke, and I thought it perfectly described my development process: "Just birds... but what if I added more?"</p>
        <p>Being a native New Englander, I also feel as though creating my own nature database has helped me to better appreciate my home. As mentioned above, my original intention was to create a database containing only information
        on birds. Thinking I needed to add a bit more pizzazz, I added a section for local flora. The result is what you see here: a database dedicated to the birds and flora local to New England.
        I hope you find it as fun to learn about New England as I did to develop it and and populate it with information.</p>
